# What's the problem?
In India, food security is very important for the citizens and this is being taken care by the Government through Public Distribution System (Ration System). However, due to the pandemic situation caused by the spread of COVID-19, it is very important to practice social distancing as well as provide the food security to the citizens. 
In the current system, citizens need to go to the Fair price shop and wait for the ration in long queues. However, there are some loopholes in the existing supply chain:
1.	Many FPS dealers resort to malpractice, illegal diversions of commodities, holding and black marketing due to the minimum salary received by them
2.	Numerous malpractices make safe and nutritious food inaccessible and un-affordable to many poor thus resulting in their food insecurity
3.	There is no set criteria as to which families are above or below the poverty line. This ambiguity gives massive scope for corruption and fallouts in PDS systems because some who are meant to benefit are not able to.
4.	There is a huge queue in which people have to stand for long time to get the ration or sometimes when it comes to their turn, the stock is over, or the shop timings are over.

# How can technology help?
1.	The citizens will be able to get the order/ ration at doorstep 
2.	Hassle free ration distribution 
3.	No waiting in the long queues 
4.	Social distancing wonâ€™t be violated
5.	Illegal diversions of commodities, holding and black marketing

# The idea
In the proposed solution, we are handling the registration of the citizen using the Ration card and the Aadhar card and the delivery of the ration will be done at doorstep to avoid the long queues which can be the issue of social distancing. There will be an option for the consumer to send notification to confirm the food/ ration deliver. Based on this notification, the database of the stock and delivery will be updated, and this will prevent the malpractices which are generally found in the process. 

# The architecture
1.	There is a portal which will have a list of citizens, along with the ration eligibility 
2.	If the stock is available in the Fair Price Shop, the order will be delivered by the Fair Price Shop to the citizens
3.	Once the order is delivered to the citizen, a notification will be sent by the citizen to the government portal and then the database will be updated
